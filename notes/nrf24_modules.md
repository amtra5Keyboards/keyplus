I haven't tried them myself, but I've heard that the EBYTE seller on ebay uses genuine nRF chips, and they are not too expensive:

Also, MikroElektronika should have geunine modules, but they are more expensive:

* RF24L01F20

I've used these types of modules from eBay/Aliexpress, there's a chance that
these modules might not use genuine nRF24L01+ chips from Nordic. The
properly work fine if they are used with other clones though.
